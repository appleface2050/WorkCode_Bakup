Mongoose is an embedded HTTP and WebSocket library that can turn anything
into a web server in 5 minutes by adding a few lines of C/C++ code.
On the market since 2004 with over 1 million cumulative downloads,
it's simplicity and flexibility has made it the top choice for
embedded software engineers.

Mongoose Binary is built on top of Mongoose Library which is used to serve Web
GUI on embedded devices, implement RESTful services, RPC frameworks (e.g.
JSON-RPC), handle telemetry data exchange and perform many other tasks. You'll find
it used across various industries including aerospace, manufacturing, finance,
research, automotive, gaming, IT and many more.

# Licensing

Cesanta made Mongoose open source under GPLv2 for a reason. We are all
developers here and appreciate easy access to code and therefore seamless
integration. It's great to be able to play around with the software before
committing to it.

However, the GPLv2 open source license does not permit incorporating the
software into non-open source programs. In order to comply with GPLv2 licensing
you need to open the source code of your end product fully or alternatively
purchase a commercial license.
