    Core Changes:
        - [Feature] Separated project to 3, technology related,
                    assemblies:
                        - Awesomium.Core (Windowsless Core)
                        - Awesomium.Windows.Controls (WPF Support)
                        - Awesomium.Windows.Forms (Windows Forms Support)
        - [Feature] Created independent Windows Forms control
                    equivalent to WPF WebControl, available through
                    the new Awesomium.Windows.Forms assembly
                    (Experimental)
        - [Feature] Added support for custom ChildProcess.
                    Executing application can also act as
                    child process
        - [Feature] Native dependencies automatically deployed
                    to Output Directory (/linkresource)
        - [Feature] Added support for installing in GAC.
                    Native dependencies included
        - [Feature] Strong Name signing. Ability to import
                    C API through the Strong Name of Awesomium.Core
                    (when installed in GAC)
        - [Feature] Added support for accessing History contents.
                    Results exposed as IEnumerable
        - [Feature] Rendering logic has been redesigned resulting
                    in dramatic improvement of performance
        - [Feature] Low level bridge wrapping the WebView C API
                    was added that acts as a common access point
                    to the native view. Also serves as a common
                    place of callbacks mapping. Significantly reduces
                    the memory used by views.
        - [Feature] InputController exposed by all views allows
                    full control over the input that is being processed
                    by a web view or web control.
